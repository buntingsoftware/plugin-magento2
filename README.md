## Bunting Personalisation (Magento 2)

Bunting's suite of machine learning tools boost conversions by serving personalized content to visitors across your site. Bunting is built for marketers, allowing you to create, launch and measure content fast.

From the moment you plug it into your site, Bunting learns about your visitors and their unique behaviour. You can then easily set up personalized messaging, recommendations, banners, emails, popups, offers and more to match your visitorsâ€™ unique wants and needs. By targeting intelligent visitor segments, you can expect to significantly raise e-commerce conversions, engagement, and order values.
